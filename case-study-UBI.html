					<h3>Usage-Based Insurance Offering</h3>
					<p>My team was tasked with applying a new telematics offering into an older commercial webrater. The purpose of this new feature was to provide a higher-risk segment, of the commercial vehicle insurance market, a pathway to insurability, under the condition that they accept enrollment into our telematics program which would be used to monitor occupation-related behaviors, e.g., stops per day, distance radius, vehicle type. We were also tasked with working this product, cleanly, into a 15-year old web rater.</p>

					<h5>RESEARCH</h5>
					<p>The research for this project was a team effort. We were given broad requirements and tasked with fleshing out the product while working it into the user flow of an existing web-based commercial insurance rater. We went through the discovery and framing process to better understand the current user flow of the web rater, to understand the telematics-offering that we would be designing and who would be using our product.

					<h5>DESIGN &amp; PROTOTYPING</h5>
					<p>Digital prototypes helped to work out the user flow as well as what and how much exposition was needed to provide a good understanding of the telematics program as well as alerting the user of their enrollment status within the program was, at any given time in the quoting process. It was important to us that we provide only the most pertinent information to the user so they had a good understanding of their enrollment status as well as how to unenroll if they chose. </p>

					<h5>TESTING</h5>
					<p>User testing the new features helped us to understand which information was valuable to users at specific points in the quoting process and which content to present depending on the product enrollment state. We went through multiple iterations of the MVP, as every new design brought fresh feedback from our users. I tested the user flow with a low-fi Adobe XD prototype.</p>

					<h5>OUTCOMES</h5>
					<p>After a few requirement updates from product which sent us back to the drawing board, we were able to validate our initial design and began development on the new product feature within our existing web rater. Upon release, we immediately began seeing telematics policies being uploaded from our pilot agencies, with over 100 new apps purchased within he first month. The feedback from agents and customer service we received was positive for the ease-of-use and understandability of the product. Once the product was released to all commercial vehicle states, it was expected to to generate up to $650K/year in revenue.</p>
