					<h3>Usage-Based Insurance Offering</h3>
					<p>My team was tasked with designing, creating and integrating a new usage-based telematics offering into our commercial webrater. The purpose of this new feature was to provide a higher-risk segment, of the commercial vehicle insurance market, a pathway to insurability, under the condition that they accept enrollment into our telematics program which would be used to monitor occupation-related behaviors, e.g., stops per day, distance radius, vehicle type. At the outset of this project, our biggest challege as a team would be creating new functionality, based on somewhat vague requirementy, in an outdated web rater interface.</p>

					<h5>RESEARCH</h5>
					<p>At the outset, wur team was given somewhat given broad requirements, which gave us an overall view of business' intention for telematics.  We went through the discovery and framing process to better understand the current user flow of the web rater, to understand the telematics-offering that we would be designing and who our target user was for this product. We knew early on who our customer was: commercial vehicle owners who were typically uninsurable due to a variety of factors. Our main area of research was in attempting to understand how telematics should work, from a business perspective, within the current user flow. As I mentioned, we were given simple requirements for the telematics program, so it became clear immediately that would need to develop a greater understanding of commercial insurance factors in order to correctly design and present the telematics product to the user. Once a general understanding of the insured factors (occupation, vehicle weight, driving radius) was acquired, we designed a matrix of telematics triggers. The creation of the matrix helped drive the design of the process within the web rater by telling us when and why the telematics offering should be applied or removed or removed from the quote.

					<h5>DESIGN &amp; PROTOTYPING</h5>
					<p>Low fidelity mockups and, later, digital prototypes helped us work out the user flow of the telematics offering. We used these early mockups and prototypes in our discussions with stakeholders to fine tune the telematics process within the applcation. Once we nailed down how the process would work, we began fine tuning the prototypes as to what and how much affordance &amp; exposition was needed to convey enrollment in the telematics program to the user, at any given time in the quoting process. As our web rater was already very information-heavy, it was important to us that we provide only the most pertinent information to the user so they had a good understanding of their enrollment status as well as how to unenroll if they chose.</p>

					<h5>TESTING</h5>
					<p>User testing the new telematics features helped us to understand which information was valuable to users at specific points in the quoting process as well as during the telematics enrollment state. As mentioned, the commercial web rater is data-heavy so we needed to ensure that the telematics features stood out to the user, to prevent unintentional user enrollment. Multiple iterations of the prototype were created, as every design tweak elicited fresh feedback from our users. User tests were created and conducted via low-fi Adobe XD prototypes.</p>

					<h5>OUTCOMES</h5>
					<p>After a few requirement updates from product which sent us back to the drawing board, we were able to validate our initial design and began development on our MVP within our existing commercial web rater. Upon release, we immediately began see telematics policies uploaded from our pilot agencies, with over 100 new apps purchased within the first month. The feedback we received from agents and customer service representatives was generally positive for the ease-of-use and understandability of the product. Once the product was released to all commercial vehicle states, it was expected to to generate up to $650K/year in revenue.</p>
