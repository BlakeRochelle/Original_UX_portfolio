					<h3>Underwriter Research Tool</h3>
					<p>Serving as the designer on a balanced team, we had recently completed development on a tool which helped agents accurately select an occupation when purchasing commercial vehicle insurance. One of the outcomes of this developing this tool was to provide our underwriters with data that could determine fraudulent activity. We realized that reviewing the data in a spreadsheet would be time-consuming and taxing on the underwriter so we determined that providing this critical decision-making information to them via a web app, presented in a way that was easy to follow, would help increase occupation accuracy and reduce associated loss. My role in this project was to undertake user research, product design and conduct user testing.</p>

					<h5>RESEARCH</h5>
					<p>We reached out to the business stakeholders and asked for contacts in the Underwriter department, who we could reach out to for discussions regarding the occupation search tool and utilizing the resulting data. We were provided around 6 contacts, at different skill levels, to begin these early talks. Over the next week, we had our initial discusions with the Underwriter group. Through our discussions, we learned how they used the data returned from the Occupation Search Tool, how they themselves used the tool in conjunction with the resulting data, which data points were important to determining fraudulent agent behavior and how we may best visualize this information to them in a way that made sense.</p>
					<p>A major outcome of these discussions with the Underwriters was the fact that they had difficulty reviewing the spreadsheet data returned from the Occupation Search Tool in an efficient &amp; timely manner. The data was used to determine if an agent was modifying a customer’s occupation to receive a more favorable rate. We learned from the Underwriters that good determining factors of fraud were the search terms used, a change in either occupation group or specific occupation and a change in rate. We found that a rate change, which was based on occupation modification, only occured once the user visited the Rate screen. Any rate change, based on a change in occupation, would require an agent to return to the initial general info screen, select a new occupation and navigate once more to the Rate screen. This was considered to be a good determining factor of suspicious, if not fraudulent, activity.</p>

					<h5>DESIGN</h5>
					<p>My early design of the tool focused on the best way to present an agent's occupation search behavior that made sense to the user and that, as much as possible, reflected the intention of an agent. From the discovery stage, we learned for certain that an abundance of search terms typically meant the agent was reviewing occupations rather than searching for a specific occupation and that we only want to focus on an occupation change if a rate had been viewed. To that end, my early designs provided users a search box to allow the underwriter to search by quote or policy ID and a resulting tabular view of the data, with each row representing a rate view. Each row presented data points for search terms, occupation category, selected occupation, rate change and which &#35; rate view the row represented. Once a search was returned, in addition to the search behavior table, I also wanted to present the user with the corresponding quote/policy ID and the date of purchase, to provide additional context to the user</p>

					<h5>DESIGN &amp; PROTOTYPING</h5>
					<p>Sketching, lo-fi mockups and digital prototypes were created to work out which occupation-related information was most useful to underwriter for evaluating risk. I went through many iterations of the data presentation as we learned more about the Underwriter’s daily habits and their work flow. It was important to us that the web application provide only the most useful information to the user while also not duplicating information that was provided and used in other applications. We were able to quickly iterate through the design and while new information and features were added, many ideas were discarded.</p>

					<h5>TESTING</h5>
					<p>We were lucky as a team in that management and our stakeholders basically provided us free reign in contacting users in the Underwriting department to participate in design review and user testing sessions. User testing our application helped in eliminating features &amp; information that the users found irrelevant or confusing while honing the presentation of the content and information that users did ffind useful. During our testing sessions, we also typically learned something new about the underwriter's day-to-day job and received feature suggestions. From these learnings and suggestions, we developed a feedback loop that became the basis for enhancements to what would become the Underwriter reseach tool for features that could enhance the tool. I user tested the user flow with prototypes created in Adobe.</p>

					<h5>OUTCOMES</h5>
					<p>Once we validated the initial design, developed our MVP and released the application to users, the underwriters came to rely on this as an essential tool. As mentioned, during our testing sessions, we constantly received enhancement suggestions and continued to iterate on the design and user test new features, which would inevitably lead to further enhancement suggestions. These user suggestions prompted us to design and develop new features, including: agency &amp; insured contact information, links to: state verification websites, Google maps, Google searches of important insured information and useful internal tools. The added features were well received and the relationships we formed led to the menitoned feedback loop, where underwriters would reach out directly to provide additional suggestions. Our interaction with the Underwriter team put us on the business leaders' radar, who began suggesting features <i>they</i> would like to see in the tool. These suggestion included providing content such as a credit scoring feature and claims-related information. Once implemented and adopted, the UW research tool increased Underwriter productivity by greatly reducing UW case research time and reducing costs by $250,000 a year, based on early estimates.</p>

					<h5>What I learned</h5>
					<p>The Underwriter Research Tool greatly reduced the underwriter's time spent reviewing dispersed information and running reports manually. Through this process, we also developed a tight relationship with our users and were able to form a constant feedback loop, which helped us to rapidly enhance the tool with requested features that helped improve underwriter effectiveness and reduced response times.</p>
