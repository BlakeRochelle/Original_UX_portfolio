					<h3>Underwriter Research Tool</h3>
					<p>Serving as the designer on a balanced team, we had recently completed development on a tool which helped agents accurately select an occupation when purchasing commercial vehicle insurance. One of the outcomes of this developing this tool was to provide our underwriters with data that could determine fraudulent activity. We realized that reviewing the data in a spreadsheet would be time-consuming and taxing on the underwriter so we determined that providing this critical decision-making information to them via a web app, presented in a way that was easy to follow, would help increase occupation accuracy and reduce associated loss. My role in this project was to undertake user research, product design and conduct user testing.</p>

					<h5>RESEARCH</h5>
					<p>We reached out to the business and asked for a few contacts in the Underwriters department. We were given around 6 contacts, at different skill levels, to reach out to for discussions. Over the next week, we had our initial discusions with the Underwriter group. Through our discussions, we learned how they used the data returned from the Occupation Search Tool, how they used the tool in conjunction with the data, what data points were important to determining fraudulent agent behavior and how we may best visualize this information to them in a way that made sense.</p>
					<p>From our initial discussions with the Underwriters, we found that they had difficulty reviewing the Occupation Search Tool data spreadsheet, in an efficient &amp; timely manner, to determine if an agent was modifying a customer’s occupation to receive a more favorable rate. We found that good determining factors would be search terms used, a change in either occupation group or specific occupation and a change in the rate. We learned that a rate change, based on occupation modiication, only happened once the user visited the Rate screen. Any rate change, based on a change in occupation, would require an agent to return to the initial general info screen, select a new occupation and navigate once more to the Rate screen. This was considered to be a good determining factor of suspicious, if not fraudulent, activity.</p>

					<h5>DESIGN</h5>
					<p>My initial design focused on the best way to present an agent's occupation search behavior that made sense to the user and that, as much as possible, reflected the intention of an agent. There were a few things we knew for certain: that an abundance of search terms typically meant the agent was reviewing occupations rather than searching for a specific occupation and that we only want to focus on an occupation change if a rate had been viewed. To that end, the early designs provided a tabular view of the date, with each row representing a rate view. Each row presented data points for search terms, occupation category, selected occupation, rate change and which # rate view the row represented. The design also incorporated a search box to allow the underwriter to search by quote or policy ID. Once a search was returned, in addition to the search behavior table, I also wanted to present the user with the corresponding quote/policy ID and the date of purchase.</p>

					<h5>SKECTHING &amp; PROTOTYPING</h5>
					<p>Sketching and digital prototypes helped to work out the main information needed in the app to present the most useful information to provide to the underwriter for evaluating risk. This step was revisited through the process as we learned more about the underwriter’s daily habits and their work flow. It was important to us that the web application provide only the most useful information to the user while also not duplicating information that was provided elsewhere. We were able to quickly iterate through the design and while new information and features were added, many more ideas were discarded .</p>

					<h5>TESTING</h5>
					<p>This step helps in eliminating steps, features & information that the user finds irrelevant or confusing. Also during our testing sessions, we typically learned something new about the underwriters day-to-day job and received suggestions for features that could enhance the tool. I tested the user flow with a low-fi Adobe XD prototype. </p>

					<h5>OUTCOMES</h5>
					<p>Once we validated the initial design, developed our lightweight research tool and released to production, the underwriters began using it daily. As mentioned, during our testing sessions, we received enhancement suggestions and began to iterate on and user test the new features, which would inevitably lead to more enhancement suggestions. This led us to add features to the design such as: agency &amp; insured contact information, links to: state verification websites, Google maps, Google searches of important insured information and useful internal tools. The new features were released and seemed to be extremely well received by the teams. Due to the relationships we formed, the underwriters began reaching out directly with suggestions and this eventually got us on the business leader’s radar, who began suggesting features they would like to see in the tool, such as credit scoring and claims information features</p>

					<h5>What I learned</h5>
					<p>The Underwriter Research Tool greatly reduced the underwriter's time spent reviewing dispersed information and running reports manually. Through this process, we also developed a tight relationship with our users and were able to form a constant feedback loop, which helped us to rapidly enhance the tool while derisking it where we could.</p>
